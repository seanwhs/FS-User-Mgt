# Full Stack React-Spring Boot Application

This repository contains the code for a full stack web application built with React on the frontend and Spring Boot on the backend. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a user management system.
I implemented this full stack application by following a video tutorial and intends to use this as a template for React-SpringBoot Full Stack Applications.

## Features

- **User Management**: Add, view, edit, and delete users.
- **RESTful API**: Backend API built with Spring Boot provides endpoints for managing users.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is built with React, providing a responsive user interface.
- **Integration with Spring Boot**: Frontend and backend are integrated to work together seamlessly.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Install the dependencies for both frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
   
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../backend
   mvn install
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   # From the backend directory
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   # From the frontend directory
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
